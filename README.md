## Class Introduction
## Jose Sanchez
The purpose of this website is to introduce myself and what i expect to learn from this online class. I have always found coding interesting and cool. By learning how to code i can really put those skills to good use and create different kinds of websites. This online course will help me get one step closer in achieving my goal of learning the proper syntax for html and the different forms to use it on a website.
